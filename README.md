# LM-PyTorch-Training

This repository contains the code for training a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module` using the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm.
The code utilizes the `torch.func` (previously known as `functorch`) to compute the Jacobian of the model with respect to its parameters.
See the notebooks `01_Function_approximation.ipynb` and `02_Possion_2D_PINNs.ipynb` for examples of how to use the code.
